## SQL Database Management Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL database management using SQL Server Management Studio, covering a wide range of concepts from basic queries to advanced database design and implementation.

## Contents

The project is divided into four main sections:

# Database Setup
Includes scripts for creating and populating the initial database structure.

# Essential SQL Skills
Covers fundamental SQL operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

# Advanced SQL Skills
Focuses on complex SQL concepts like views, stored procedures, functions, triggers, and transactions.

# Database Design
Involves creating and analyzing database diagrams, including normalization to the third normal form.

## Key Features

- Creation and manipulation of tables
- Basic and advanced querying techniques
- Data modification operations
- Implementation of database objects (views, stored procedures, functions)
- Database triggers and transaction management
- Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram creation and analysis
- Database normalization

## Files Included

- `CreatMyCollege.sql`: Script to create the initial database structure
- `InstructorDetails.sql`: Query for instructor details
